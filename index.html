    </div>

    <p>The phrase "differential equation" is such a menacing pair of science words it almost sounds made up, like "flux capacitor." Indeed, if what Barzun says is true, just looking at them melted someone. But fear not. The goal here isn't to help anyone pass <a href='http://bayen.eecs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/PDE/expandedDescription.pdf'>Control of Distribution Parameter Systems</a>; it's just to give a quick introduction to one of the most wonderful tools we have to interpret and redesign the world.</p>

    <h3>definition</h3>

    <p>You're probably used to regular old equations like $ t^2 +t = 2 $. Here, "solving the equation" means finding numbers that make the statement true. Below, change $ t $ until it's true that $ t^2 + t = 2 $.</p>

    <div ng-controller="funCtrl as fun" class='row'>
      <div fun-plot-left class='col-xs-8'></div>
    </div>

    <p>A differential equation is a statement that involves a derivative, and <strong>solving a differential equation means finding a function whose derivative makes the statement true.</strong> The answer is not a number; it's a machine that transforms them.</p>

    <!--     <p>The solution to this equation is $t^2+2t +C$, where $C$ can be any number. To that $C$ is open-ended, drag this slider to shift the dots up and down, noting the derivative stays the same.</p> -->

    <h3>one equation to rule them all</h3>

    <p>Suppose you have student loans with an interest rate of $k$. If you don't make any payments, your debt, $y$, will grow according to the diffEQ</p>

    $$ y' = k \cdot y. \,\,\, (\mathcal{A}) $$

    <p>This says, "The rate-of-change of $y$ is a multiple of $y$." If you solve it, you'll get a function $y(t)$ telling how much debt you have at time $t$. Below, you'll solve it manually. </p>
    <p>Click the <span id='left'>left plot</span> to drop points, which draw a function <span id="y">y(t)</span>. The <span id='der'>derivative</span>, $y'$, becomes <span id='yprime'>$y'(t)$</span> on the <span id='middle'>middle plot</span>. The diffEQ $(\mathcal{A})$ appears as a <span id='target'>target</span> on the <span id='right'>right plot</span>, which has $y$ on the horizontal axis and $y'$ on the vertical. See if you can draw $y(t)$ to give the right relationship. To delete a point, right-click it.</p>

    <h3>fact? or friction?</h3>

    <p>
      Let's use this diffEQ in a more physical example. Suppose you launch a wheeled cart at velocity $v_0$. Friction slows it down at a rate $k$ proportional to the velocity; that is, the faster it's going, the more friction slows it down. Now we have
    </p>

    $$ v' = -kv $$

    <p>
      just like above, except the coefficient on $v$ is negative.
