    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      As long as nineteenth-centry spellbinders of science could point to the planets and the Milky Way, or could descant on a piece of chalk to unfold the history of the earth, they held their audience. But with nothing to see except a blackboard strewn with differential equations, the educated man with an informed interest in science melted away.

    <p>The phrase "differential equation" is intimidating. It's a combination of two science words, like "flux capacitor" and "tachyon field." If what Barzun says is true, the mere sight of them melted someone.</p>
    <p>But fear not. Differential equations are your friends. The goal here is not to help anyone pass "Control of Distributed Parameter Systems." It is to show off one of the most wonderful tricks we have to comprehend and design the world around us.</p>

    <p>A differential equation is a relationship that involves the derivative (i.e., the slope) of a function &mdash; such as $f'(t) = 2t - 5 $ or $ f''(t) - 3f'(t) + 2f(t)=3. $ Solving a differential equation means finding a function that makes it true. Basically, you start out knowing some fact about the derivative of a mystery function, and you ask yourself, "For which function $ f (t) $ is this fact about its derivative true?"</p>
    <!-- <p></p> -->

    <p>You're probably used to equations like $ t^2 +t = 2 $. Here, "solving the equation" means finding numbers that make the equation true. Below, let the left-hand side be the function $ L(t) â‰¡ t^2 + t$ and change $ t $ until $ L(t) = 2 $.</p>

    INSERT PLOT

    <p>Instead of specific numbers, the solutions to differential equations are functions. </p>

    \[ f'(t) = 2t - 5. \, \,\,\,\, (\mathcal{A}) \]

    <p>Now, on the plot below, see if you can draw a function whose derivative satisfies $ \mathcal{A}$. To get started, choose the general form of the function and then click some dots. We'll fill in the best-fit function.</p>


    <p>When would you want to solve for a function? One of the most common cases is a situation where you want to predict something. For example, suppose you pulled the block below to the right or left and then let go. Where will the block be in 5, 6 or 7 seconds? To answer, you'll need a function like $ L(t) $ that gives the block's location for any time, $ t $.</p>
