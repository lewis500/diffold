use defs to mask out the other parts of the plots
have the function picker start out with some dots drawn
make one for f' = f(x)
put labels to follow lines around


FIXER PLOT
share the data
stop cutting off the data a few times after your dots. let it ride out.
get rid of the object/array dichotomy
when you click on the left plot, have it draw the slope and show that slope on the right plot as a bar

display the functions.

REAL-TIME MATHJAX UPDATING



make the plot with its slope as a magnitude
add arrows
make the circles pulse
add a voronoi for the circle selections
